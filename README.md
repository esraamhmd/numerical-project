# Numerical Project

## Overview

The Numerical Project is a collection of numerical methods and algorithms implemented in Python. It serves as a resource for students, educators, and professionals who are interested in numerical analysis and computational mathematics. This repository includes implementations of various numerical techniques, along with examples and documentation.

## Features

- **Root Finding Algorithms:** Implementations of methods like Bisection, Newton-Raphson, and Secant.
- **Linear Systems Solvers:** Methods for solving linear equations, including Gaussian Elimination and LU Decomposition.
- **Interpolation and Extrapolation:** Techniques such as Lagrange Polynomials and Newton's Divided Differences.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for implementing numerical methods. Python's simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for educational purposes and complex numerical computations.
- **Tkinter:** A standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library in Python used to create desktop applications. In this project, Tkinter is utilized to build interactive interfaces for demonstrating the numerical methods.
